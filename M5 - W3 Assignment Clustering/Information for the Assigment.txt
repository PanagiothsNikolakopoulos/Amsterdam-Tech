Assigment Instructions:

Unsupervised learning is very useful in the domain of customer segmentation and understanding, among others. Often we have data about customers’ behavior, purchasing habits and website visits and we want 
to draw insights
 from the data, so that we can optimize our marketing strategies and ultimately, increase conversion.

In this assignment, you are asked to work with the ‘Mall customer segmentation data’ from Kaggle.

->Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python. Clean the data and perform exploratory steps that you deem appropriate. Remember that it might be important 
  to normalise the data before you perform clustering.
-?Perform clustering of the data (K-means or hierarchical clustering; or if you prefer - both). How many clusters are there in the data and why?
->How will your translate the clusters into business insight? In other words, what advice would you give the mall owner, so that they can design a marketing strategy using your insights.
There are some particularly good kernels that use this data set, make sure you submit your own work and are not inspired by other people’s solutions.

Submit a Jupyter notebook/python script with your code, and if you want, submit a link to a GitHub repository where you have also stored your code.
