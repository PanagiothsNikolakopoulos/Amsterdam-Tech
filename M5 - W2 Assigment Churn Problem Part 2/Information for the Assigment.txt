Assigment Instructions:

This week we continue with where we left off from last week. This week’s job will be pretty straight-forward and it will be Machine Learning-based. Your goal will be to grab the work you have already done and start training a model that is able to predict which customers are more likely to churn.

Select three different models that you would like to test your dataset with. Make sure that at least two of them are tree-based models. 

Explain why you selected these three models. You might want to discuss their peformance, explainability, complexity, etc. 

Based on the metric you have selected in last week’s assignment, make a comparative analysis between the performance of your models. What needs to be fixed when comparing different machine learning models?

Do you believe you have overfitting? Why yes or why not?
