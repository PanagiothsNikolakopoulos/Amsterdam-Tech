#For Question A3, the t-statistic is negative (-1.85) and the p-value is 0.066, which suggests that there is some evidence of a difference between men and women's responses, but it is not statistically significant at the conventional level of 0.05.
#For Question B3, the t-statistic is positive (0.15) and the p-value is 0.88, which suggests that there is not a statistically significant difference between men and women's responses.
#For Question C2, the t-statistic is positive (1.28) and the p-value is 0.20, which suggests that there is not a statistically significant difference between men and women's responses.
#For Question D3, the t-statistic is positive (1.15) and the p-value is 0.25, which suggests that there is not a statistically significant difference between men and women's responses.
#For Question E3, the t-statistic is negative (-0.67) and the p-value is 0.50, which suggests that there is not a statistically significant difference between men and women's responses.
#Overall, based on these results, we can conclude that there is no strong evidence of a significant difference in responses between men and women for any of the questions. However, for Question A3, there is some evidence of a difference that falls just short of statistical significance.
